Now you've seen the basics of an event based system, the creation and observation of events, you can start to
add in more conceptual pieces.

* _Views_, a way to process streams of events into data structures that can be queried efficiently.
* _Aggregate Roots_, components that store state, generate events, and enforce rules about how they relate to each other. Often, implemented as a formal state machine using XState.
* _Commands_, components that record changes to the system by taking events and emitting them to streams.
* _Sagas_, event driven workflows. Implementing asynchronous business logic and integration with external systems in a way that safely isolates
them from your core application logic.
